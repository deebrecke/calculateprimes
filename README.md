# calculateprimes
Determines whether a number is prime, outputs factors of the number or tells you what primes are in a certain range.
In the first section, the user inputs a positive whole number. The program says if it is prime or not prime, displaying all factors of the number.
If the user inputs a negative number, the output says it's not prime and that there are no factors (which is not actually mathmatically accurate, but for the purpose of this program, factors of negative numbers are ignored). 
If the input is a positive number that isn't a whole number, the program truncates it and outputs the resulf of the truncated number (8.3 would calculate as 8, 9.9 would calculate as 9).
In the second section, the user inputs a range of numbers and the program determines what primes are in the range inclusively.
